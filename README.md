# Cold Email Generator ðŸ“§

Welcome to the **Cold Email Generator**, an interactive Streamlit application that takes a careers page URL, extracts job postings, and generates a highly customized cold email. This tool leverages AI to parse job descriptions, highlight your company's capabilities, and produce compelling outreach emails.

## Features

- **Input:** Provide any careers page URL from which the app will scrape job postings.
- **Multiple Output Formats:** Choose between Markdown, HTML, or Plain Text for the generated cold emails.
- **Limit Displayed Jobs:** Control how many job listings to display and include in the email.
- **Auto-Fetched Portfolio Links:** Automatically query a portfolio (stored locally) to match job skills with relevant portfolio examples.

## How It Works

1. **Enter a URL:** Input a careers URL into the text field.
2. **Select Format & Number of Jobs:** Use the sidebar to choose your email format and how many jobs to highlight.
3. **Generate Email:** Click "Submit" to process the URL, extract job data, and produce your customized cold email.

## Under the Hood

- **Data Extraction:** Utilizes `WebBaseLoader` to scrape and clean content from the given URL.
- **LLM-Powered Analysis:** Uses a large language model (via the Groq API) to parse job descriptions and format the output.
- **ChromaDB Integration:** Links skills to related portfolio items stored in ChromaDB, showcasing relevant past work and capabilities.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors related to large context size, consider reducing the input size by chunking the content or summarizing before extraction.
For issues related to ChromaDB storage or data migration, ensure youâ€™re using a compatible Chroma version and have deleted old vectorstore directories if needed.
Check the Streamlit logs and printed outputs for debugging messages.
