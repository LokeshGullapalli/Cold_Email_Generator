- **LangChain / LLM:** For AI-driven parsing and email generation.
- **Python:** The main language for server-side logic and data handling.
- **Groq API:** Accessing a large language model for intelligent text analysis.

## Troubleshooting
- **Context Too Big:** If you encounter a "Context too big" error, consider breaking the input text into chunks before processing.
